        I'm currently building my portfolio and sharpening my skills in full-stack
        development and cybersecurity. I'm especially interested in combining
        React-based frontends with secure, modern backend practices â€” whether it's
        through personal tools or bigger collaborative projects. I believe in writing
        clean, maintainable code and designing systems that solve problems efficiently.
