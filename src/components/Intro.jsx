        I’m an aspiring Software Engineer and Information Security Analyst
        with a passion for ethical hacking, full-stack development, and building secure,
        scalable systems. I enjoy learning how things work under the hood — and how to
        protect them. Whether I'm working on a personal project or exploring new tech,
        I strive to bridge functionality with security and clean design.
